TODO List for update-manager:

milestone 0.201.0:

* Document bug script protocol.

  The bug script protocol needs to be documented.

* Separate categories for new or removed packages

  Packages that are newly added or removed by an upgrade should be
   displayed in separate categories in the upgrade list. This requires
   updates to PackageInfo and PackageInfoStore so dependency
   calculation works correctly for these two types of entries.

milestone later:

* Reimplement DistUpgrader

  Not needed for Debian, but really needed for Ubuntu. The
   DistUpgrader should be re-implemented, making use of the new
   design/infrastructure.

* Implement update-notifier

  This is a work in progress. A separate branch can be found at
   http://bzr.debian.org/update-manager/devel/update-notifier-frontend.

* Update Exceptions for Python 2.6 compatiblity.

  All exceptions use the "message" parameter in their constructors
   right now. This has been deprecated as of Python 2.6 and so all
   Exceptions should be updated.
